# Part 2:  The ability to learn task

Question:

Write a short paragraph outlining the steps you would take to test and improve the wireframe provided.

Answer:

There are many different methods to for testing and improving the wireframe given, traditional and non-traditional. From the research I have conducted, it seems that the first appropriate step to improving the wireframe is to initiate user testing sessions. Having users test the wireframe allows UX teams to gather direct information from their target audiences and help to find existing problems in the product. For example, during testing some participants might find the lack of information shown in the Video Log wireframe, leaves them confused as what exactly the company's services are. Also, the wireframe doesn't provide any labels within the contact form this is problem for users with screen readers as they won't be able to identify what the input is for. The participants can be people in the office or enthusiastic volunteers.

With information gathered from the user testing sessions (e.g. A/B Testing, Focus Groups, Usability Testing), as well as more info from follow up questions, we can now begin creating our new requirements and redesigning our product to fit them. Using fast building tools such as Adobe Xd we can quickly create an refectored version, and provide links within our team for evaluation. Then once again we will repeat the process of user testing to further improve the new and improved wireframe. This will continue indefinitely, or as long as the product has a target audience.
