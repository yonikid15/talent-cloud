# Part 2:  The ability to learn task

Question:

Write a short paragraph outlining the steps you would take to test and improve the wireframe provided.

Answer:

There are many different methods to for testing and improving the wireframe given, traditional and non-traditional. From the research I have conducted, it seems that the first appropriate step to improving the wireframe is to initiate user testing sessions. Having users test the wireframe allows UX teams to gather direct information from their target audiences and help to find existing problems in the product. For example, during testing some participants might find the lack of information used in the Video Log wireframe doesn't give enough information, leaving them confused as what the company's services are. Also, the wireframe doesn't provide any labels within the contact form this is problem for users with screen readers as they won't be able to identify what the input is for.

With information gathered from the user testing sessions (e.g. A/B Testing, Focus Groups, Usability Testing), as well as more info from follow up questions, we can now begin creating our new requirements and redesigning our product to fit them. Then once again we need to test the improved wireframe. This will continue indefinitely, or as long as the product has a target audience.
